            <h2>Michael Jordan vs. Lebron James. Who is the better player?</h2>
            <p>Both LeBron James and Michael Jordan are very close in their statistics and are considered the greatest athletes to ever play in the NBA. 
                LeBron has a near-perfect all-around game with great athleticism and strength, while MJ has the praise and respect for his championships, game winning shots/plays, 
                and excellent scoring ability. Considering the regular season stats, playoff stats, and accolades achieved, it is however a safer bet to place 
                Michael Jordan firmly atop the NBA as the best ever.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>A 6-0 Finals record with 6 rings beats out a 4-6 Finals record with 4 rings, and MJ seems to be a better player in the playoffs considering his low turnover rate and extremely 
                efficient scoring. If LeBron James manages to win another ring this year, this conversation might start up again and then it will be time to revisit the comparison. 
                But for now, MJ is still the leader in the GOAT talk.
