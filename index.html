        <h1>Hi! I'm Alex Choi</h1>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <p class="paragraphs">
                I am currently a second year undergraduate student at the University of Michigan who is passionate about the intersection between 
                statistics/data science and pharmaceutical sciences. I hope to use my growing analytical skills in creating interdisciplinary
                techniques that can create meaningful discoveries or predictions. After taking more programming and math courses, I've gained a better understanding 
                of how it is logical to connect the health field and the way of analyzing data computationally and mathematically.  
                <br><br>    
                My interest and past experience in statistics has made me value the quality of analyses and conclusions throughout scientific studies 
                and research. My desire to further pursue this field has helped me to think differently and philospohically about using math and data to be better 
                about decision making, just like deciding what field of study would fit me best. I hope that my passion for analyzing data can go beyond the 
                pharmaceutical field and become versatile to a wide range of fields, such as my other interests in product analytics as more users depend on the growth of data.    

                <br><br>
                Outside of academics, I enjoy playing tennis and cello, watching basketball, reading books, and fishing.
