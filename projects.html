                <p>
                    I documented the strategies that were used to characterize and analyze the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of bevacizumab, an anti-cancer drug, 
                    following the administration of SB8 or Avastin® in healthy subjects and patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
                    <br>
                    Using the programming language R and SAS, I assisted in the analysis of the population PK by cleaning and simulating data from one Phase I study in 
                    healthy male subjects who received SB8, EU Sourced or US Sourced Avastin® and one Phase III study in NSCLC patients receiving SB8 or EU Sourced Avastin®. 
                    Through this process, the PK sample concentrations, PK sample dates and times, dose amounts and times, patient demographics and other covariates were 
                    created in the data. In addition, I imposed any resolutions or strategies about any missing data, such as missing dose dates.

                <h2><a href="file:///C:/Users/Alex/Downloads/Poster.pdf" target="_blank"> Algorithms in Graph Theory: An Investigation into the Shortest Path Problem 
                    under Uncertainty</a></h2>
                <p>
                    I studied an aspect of graph theory known as the shortest path problem, whereby one has to find the shortest path from one node to another given the 
                    weight (distance/time/cost etc.) of the individual arcs joining the adjacent nodes. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is a well-known method for this matter, and I 
                    have based my approach on it using the Java language to solve large problems representing traffic navigation, communications routing, and etc. I 
                    incorporated uncertainty into the weights of the arcs so that they reflect reality more closely. In addition, I developed a scheme that applies Dijkstra’s 
                    Algorithm to find the ideal path for the choice of risk tolerance given the probabilistic distribution of the random weights of the arcs. I have implemented 
                    my method on real-world problems with actual as well as computer generated data and performed probabilistic analyses on the results using the Monte Carlo 
                    simulation.
